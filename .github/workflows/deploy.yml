        # NOTE: You need to change /repo-name/ to your actual repository name followed by a slash.
        # If you are using a custom domain or user page (username.github.io), remove the --base-href flag or set it to /.
        # For a generic solution, I'll leave it as a comment in the file for the user or attempt to detect it?
        # A safer bet for now is assuming the user will configure it, OR I can use a script to determine it.
        # But commonly users just want "it to work".
        # I'll use a placeholder and warn the user in README, or try to be smart.
        # Actually, for the first run, let's just run `npm run build` and let the user customize base-href if needed.
        # Many users deploy to custom domains or root.
